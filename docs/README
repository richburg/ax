About
=====

Lightweight, easy-to-deploy and minimal TCP chatting server. It was mainly designed for small communities but doesn't lack anything regarding security.

Protocol
========

`ax` uses its own protocol. Message formatting is same for both server and client:

class Payload:
    message: str
    args: list[str]

Example `payload.message`: INCOMING_MESSAGE
Example `payload.args`: [<author>, <content>]
